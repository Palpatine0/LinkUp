# LinkUp

## Introduction

LinkUp is a mobile app that connects travelers with local guides for personalized experiences at designated destinations. The platform is divided into two user roles:
- **Travelers** – users looking for someone to accompany or guide them on a trip.
- **Guides** – users who are willing to accompany or assist travelers for compensation.

## Features

- `Order Publishing & Acceptance` : Travelers can create and post orders describing where they want to go, when, and how much they’re willing to pay for a guide. These orders are visible to all registered guides, who can browse through available listings and choose to accept ones that fit their schedule and expertise. This system ensures flexible matching between travelers and local guides based on mutual interest and availability.
- `Messaging & Gifting` : The app includes an integrated chat feature that allows real-time communication between travelers and guides after an order is accepted. Travelers also have the option to send paid virtual gifts to guides as a token of gratitude or to build rapport, creating a more engaging and appreciative experience on the platform.
- `Balance & Currency Management` : Users can deposit real money into their in-app account called the “Looking Card.” This balance is then converted into a virtual currency called “Looking Coins.” These coins can be used throughout the platform to post new orders, send gifts to guides, or unlock premium features, enabling a seamless and self-contained financial ecosystem.
- `Referral System` : Users can generate unique referral links to invite friends or followers to join the platform. If a referred user registers and makes a purchase within the app—such as posting an order or buying gifts—the inviter automatically earns a commission. This incentivizes organic growth and rewards users for promoting the app.
